                <p>Like an umbrella turned into a mouse.</p>
                <p>The moon is astonished and so are the sheep:</p>
                <p>Their bells have come to send you to sleep.</p>

                <p>Sleep little baby, clean as a nut,</p>
                <p>Your fingers uncurl and your eyes are shut.</p>
                <p>Your life was ours, which is with you.</p>
